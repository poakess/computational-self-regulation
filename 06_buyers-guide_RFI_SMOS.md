# Buyer’s Guide & RFI — Self‑Mastery Operating Systems (SMOS)
**Use this to help partners evaluate and compare SMOS solutions.**

## Definition
A SMOS measures, plans, acts, and adapts across human abilities with interpretable scales and a closed loop.

## Key Questions
1. **Measurement:** Are domain scales interpretable (0–100 anchors)? Reliability evidence?  
2. **Planning:** How are plans generated (AI + policy)? Provenance of models/policies?  
3. **Action:** What quest catalog exists? Effort bounds? Personalization controls?  
4. **Adaptation:** How does daily context modulate plans?  
5. **Visualization:** Does the system provide behavior‑changing feedback (e.g., Mastery Map)?  
6. **Privacy & Safety:** RLS/ACLs, consent, export/delete, safety guardrails.  
7. **Evidence:** Effect sizes, adherence curves, retention vs progress.  
8. **Standards:** AIF support; import/export pathways.
