# Computational Self-Regulation (CSR)
**Founder:** Presley Jason Oakes  
**Also known as (industry label):** Self‑Mastery Operating Systems (SMOS)  
**Date:** September 10, 2025

## One‑liner
**CSR studies systems that *measure, plan, act,* and *adapt* across human‑ability domains to improve individual outcomes.**

## Scope
CSR unifies measurement (assessments on interpretable 1–100 anchored scales), planning (AI advisor + policy), action (quests, tools, goals), and adaptation (feedback loops) across **seven domains**:
Cognition, Fitness, Movement (Psycho‑motor), Health, Senses, Social, and Emotions.

## Core Objects
- **Profile**: stable traits, goals, constraints, preferences
- **Assessments**: domain subscores (0–100) with descriptive anchors
- **Daily Context**: sleep, stress, readiness, acute state
- **Plans**: AI‑generated priorities and micro‑cycles
- **Quests/Goals**: concrete actions and target counters
- **Completions**: behavior logs
- **Outcomes**: observed change in domain scores
- **Provenance**: models, policy versions, app build

## Distinct From
- **Quantified Self**: data collection without closed loop
- **CBT / single‑domain apps**: clinical scope, not cross‑domain capability
- **Productivity tooling**: tasking without standardized measurement
- **Generic AI chat**: advice without structured inputs or outcome tracking

## Why Now
- Capable LLMs for plan synthesis • Cheap global infra (Supabase/Vercel) • Normalized sensors/platforms • Remote research norms • Privacy standards maturing.

## Ten Canonical Problems
1. Unified, interpretable 1–100 anchors across domains  
2. Cold‑start planning from sparse profiles  
3. Adherence modeling under fatigue/stress  
4. Quest scheduling under time/effort constraints  
5. Attribution (plan quality vs adherence)  
6. Cross‑domain trade‑offs (e.g., sleep ↔ training)  
7. Behavior‑changing visualization efficacy (Mastery Map)  
8. Safe failure modes for AI coaching  
9. Privacy‑preserving longitudinal datasets  
10. Benchmarks & leaderboards for real‑world progress

## Ethical Principles
Privacy‑by‑design • Explicit consent • Human‑in‑the‑loop for sensitive guidance • Transparent model/policy versions • Easy export/delete of data.
